RFID
==========

An RFID POS (Point Of Sale) application that can be used with numeric RFID strings.

The system was developed by realfagskjelleren for use at the student cellar in Trondheim, Norway.
It will work with NTNU student cards and employee cards at least, but any card with an RFID string
of 8-20 digits will work.
